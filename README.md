# Recycle Hub

Created with CRA, Typescript, Redux, Redux-toolkit, SCSS
Spent around 6 hours on task, some of the crucial things like proxy for api requests and unit tests are left out.

To run the project locally:
### `git clone https://github.com/gokhanipek/recyclehub.git`
### `cd recyclehub`

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

### Todos:
- [ ] A nicer looking UI - 2 hours
- [ ] Unit Tests - 2 hours
- [ ] add proxy for the api requests, right now requests can only be done from localhost:3000 - 1 hour
